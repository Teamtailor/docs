## Embed application form

> Example iframe

```html
<iframe src="https://career.teamtailor.com/jobs/7199-new-title/applications/new?iframe=true"
style="width: 100%; height: 800px"
frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

> Iframe helper script

```html
<script src="https://www.teamtailor.com/widget/apply.js"></script>
```

To embed an application form on your website, create an `<iframe>` and set
the `src` attribute to the job's `careersite-job-apply-iframe-url` attribute.

Remember to set `frameborder="0"` and `style="width: 100%; height: 800px"`.

To enable features such as auto-resize of the iframe, insert the helper script
to the right in the `<head>` section of your page.
