A stage indicate the candidate status for a job-application. The stages are defined for each job. Each job has two default stages which can't be deleted or modified:

* Inbox with the *stage-type* `Inbox`
* Hired with the *stage-type* `Hired`

All other user created stages have the *stage-type* `In process`
